# Project Folder Organization

I'm gonna be honest, I don't know the best way to organize this document, I'm more into the idea of an open source band than a professional musician that knows the most effective way to structure things. I made a couple of folders, if anyone wants to contact me or make a branch that handles things better, do so, that'd be great.

Make a folder and sign your name in a txt, and give whatever info you think is important

It's probably a good idea to say where you got your stuff from / keep those source files in with the stems / whatever you upload

I added an uncleared sample folder. The only way stuff from this section should be included is thorugh clearing the sample yourself / getting that to happen, or doing a cover of the section you want to use.
