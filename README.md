# Unofficial-unnamed-band-folder

Welcome to the Unofficial Unnamed Band Folder! This repository contains project files that anyone can interact with. This document tells you how to download the project folder and how to add your files to this project. For info about the organization of this project folder, [click here](structure.md).

I'm not the person behind the project, that would be Johnny Morrison. They are away from their computer and I thought I would go ahead with making this so files can be shared among people working on the project. This is a temporary thing I plan on handing over when Johnny's back at their keyboard.
(I'm willing to keep helping with this thing, but it's not my project and I don't want to steal your glory or master architect position)

Things are currently being run through [this temporary subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MorrisonProductions/), but the project is likely going to move over to a discord server in the near future, when some more logisitcs are figured out.

## Project Rules  

1. **No Uncleared Samples**  
   Avoid using samples that aren’t cleared or legally safe. This is a collaborative project. You can use copyrighted audio as a placeholder, but **YOU** are responsible for figuring out a way to clear that sample or getting someone to cover it if you want your work to be released. You should say where you got any samples you used and what type of permission you have to use it.

2. **Share Your WIP Files** *(optional but encouraged)*  
   Everyone’s work-in-progress files are rough, but this is a band, we should be workign together. Sharing them helps make ideas as good as they can be, helps catch potential issues (like uncleared samples) early, and keeps this project collaborative and open for everyone.

---

1. **No Uncleared Samples:**
   - Ensure that all samples used in the project are cleared and legally permissible to use. Respect copyright laws and avoid any uncleared or pirated samples.

2. **Give Where you got your Samples:**
   - If you take material from anywhere, give a link to where you got it from if through the internet, or name the source, or whatever information to find them. If it's a local group, you need to get permission and save that with the sample.

3. **Share WIP Files:**
   - This is a band of the people, we gotta work together! Everyone's work in progress work is bad, but if we work together, we can make something the world has never seen! This isn't a strict requirement. Shit happens, but it's important logistically, and this way we can catch problems like uncleared samples and whatnot early and work around them together.

## License

IDK, ask Johnny, leaving it blank for now. They were saying something about album revinue going to charity or the people who worked on the various tracks. To me it seems like most stuff is in the air, they were figuring stuff out as they went along, and if this github becomes official, there's a good chance this project leans full on open source free to access with any profits from donations, record sales, streaming services with ads, etc going back into the project directly with marketing or whatever.
