# Unofficial-unnamed-band-folder

Welcome to the Unofficial Unnamed Band Folder! This repository contains project files that anyone can interact with. This document tells you how to download the project folder and how to add your files to this project. For info about the organization of this project folder, [click here](structure.md).

I'm not the person behind the project, that would be Johnny Morrison. They are away from their computer and I thought I would go ahead with making this so files can be shared among people working on the project. This is a temporary thing I plan on handing over when Johnny's back at their keyboard.
(I'm willing to keep helping with this thing, but it's not my project and I don't want to steal your glory or master architect position)

Things are currently being run through [this temporary subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MorrisonProductions/), but the project is likely going to move over to a discord server in the near future, when some more logistics are figured out.

## How to Download

### Option 1: GitHub Desktop (With GUI, easier for non-programmers)

   - Go to the [GitHub Desktop website](https://desktop.github.com/), and click the download button.

2. **Install GitHub Desktop:**
   - Follow the installation instructions.

3. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Open GitHub Desktop.
   - Click **File > Clone repository**.  
   - Under the "URL" tab, paste:  
     `https://github.com/neburtron/Unofficial-unnamed-band-folder`  
   - Choose where to save the project and click **Clone**.

4. **Explore the Project:**  
   - You did it, you've got all the files, from here you're good to go.
   - It should tell you when the public files update, and give you the option to update your local files.

### Option 2: Command Line (For Programmers)

1. **Install Git:**  
   If you don’t have Git installed, download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

## Project Rules  

1. **No Uncleared Samples**  
   Avoid using samples that aren’t cleared or legally safe.
   This is a collaborative project.
   You can use copyrighted audio as a placeholder, but **YOU** are responsible for figuring out a way to clear that sample or getting someone to cover it if you want your work to be released.
   You should say where you get any samples you used and what type of permission you have to use it.

2. **Share Your WIP Files** *(optional but encouraged)*  
   Everyone’s work-in-progress files are rough, but this is a band, we should be working together. Sharing them helps make ideas as good as they can be, helps catch potential issues (like uncleared samples) early, and keeps this project collaborative and open for everyone.

## Contribution Guidelines

How to add your new material to the project. If you can't figure it out, email me and I can add it for you.

These steps assume you're using Github Desktop.

1. **Make sure you have an up to date and unedited verion of the project folder**
   - Github tracks changes, so make sure you didn't touch anything you shouldn't have, and make sure that you're not looking at an outdated version of the folder.

2. **Create a Branch:**
   - Create a new branch by opening this menu and clicking this new branch.

3. **Name it:**

4. **Make Changes:**
   - Make whatever changes you want made.

5. **Commit Changes:**
   - Commit your changes in the bottom left

6. **Push Changes:**
   - Push your changes to your forked repository when it pops up, there's enough screenshots here, you'll see it.

7. **Create a Pull Request:**
   - Open a pull request from your forked repository's branch to the main branch of this repository. If you've gotten this far, you'll be able to figure it out.

Note - It's a good idea to make a folder around stuff you add for organizations sake, even if you're just adding one or a few little audio clips, if you decide to add more later on or sign your name in a txt, that makes things easier.

## License

TBD, ask Johnny. They were saying something about album revinue going to charity or the people who worked on the various tracks. To me it seems like most stuff is in the air, they were figuring stuff out as they went along, and if this github becomes official, there's a good chance this project leans full on open source free to access with any profits from donations, record sales, streaming services with ads, etc going back into the project directly with marketing or whatever.

## Contact

 I'm MuteMAR / Ru Baton / Neburtron, my email's [MuteMaroonWorm@Gmail.com](mailto:MuteMaroonWorm@Gmail.com). I'm the guy that had the gall to make an unofficial github page for this thing, no other authority or qualifications.
